It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map.
For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again.
There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight.
What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light.
Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back.
