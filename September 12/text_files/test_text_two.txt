​At the end of the month, The Protego Foundation team will host a live meeting where
we’ll discuss all of the magical creatures we've encountered!
You can REGISTER to join in on the meeting and share your opinions and thoughts with us.
And don't worry—even if you don't finish the book before the end of the month,
you can still join us in the live event, or watch the discussion here afterward!
